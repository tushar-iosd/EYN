Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code.

-> Closures can capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined, known as closing over hence Closure.

() Doesnâ€™t have a name of its own.
() Can captures any values from its environment.

-> Functions and closures are first-class objects in Swift: you can store them, pass them as arguments to functions, and treat them as you would any other value or object
